<p>I am currently a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.google">Google DeepMind</a>, where I do research on really large-scale machine learning models. A recurring theme of my work is to explore quality-resource tradeoffs by applying fundamental ideas from randomized algorithms (i.e. make it faster with math) and compression (i.e. make it smaller with math).</p>

<p>I completed my PhD at <a href="https://eceweb.rice.edu">Rice University</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/">Anshumali Shrivastava</a>. Previously, I attended Florida Atlantic University High School in Boca Raton FL, where I concurrently attended high school and college. I've also worked at Google Brain, Amazon AWS and A9, Adobe Research, and several startups.</p>

<p>My goal for this blog is to make my work more accessible to practitioners and researchers outside my area. Most research articles are written in a formal style for an expert audience. This format is a great way to deliver detailed technical information, but I think that pictures and informal articles can convey intuition more effectively.</p>

<p>My definition of fun includes real analysis and combinatorics, but I'm also into cycling, dance and cooking. Feel free to contact me at benjamin [dot] ray [dot] coleman [at] gmail with questions, suggestions or feedback.</p>
